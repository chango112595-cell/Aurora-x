# Aurora Self-Diagnosis & Improvement Plan

**Date:** 2025-11-21 17:44:58

## Self-Diagnosis Request


    Aurora, run a complete self-diagnosis and improvement analysis.
    
    Using your newly connected autonomous systems and intelligence manager:
    
    1. Diagnose your current state across all systems
    2. Identify gaps, inefficiencies, or underutilized capabilities
    3. Analyze what's working well and what needs improvement
    4. Propose specific, actionable improvements you can implement
    5. Prioritize improvements by impact
    
    Be thorough, technical, and honest. Use your autonomous capabilities to scan
    your own code, analyze your architecture, and create a concrete improvement plan.

    Aurora, analyze port 9000 and the aurora_chat_server.py:
    
    CURRENT SITUATION:
    - Port 9000 is NOT running (shows as [ERROR] in your self-diagnostic)
    - aurora_chat_server.py defaults to port 9000
    - It's described as "Chat Server" but we also have:
      - Port 5173 (Vite Frontend) 
      - Port 5000 (Frontend)
      - Terminal chat (chat_with_aurora.py) which talks to you directly
    
    QUESTIONS:
    1. What is port 9000 / aurora_chat_server.py actually used for?
    2. Is it redundant now that we have enhanced terminal chat with execution mode?
    3. Do we need to start it, or can we deprecate it?
    4. What functionality would we lose if we don't run it?
    5. Is it part of your web UI, or is it a separate chat interface?
    
    Give me your architectural analysis: Should port 9000 be running, or is it obsolete?

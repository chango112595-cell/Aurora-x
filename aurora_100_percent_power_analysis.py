AURORA, FULL POWER ANALYSIS REQUEST:

Use 100% of your 188 integrated capabilities to perform a complete system analysis.

ANALYSIS SCOPE:
1. Your own architecture - what's working, what's broken
2. All integration points - where are disconnections?
3. Unused capabilities - what powers do you have that aren't active?
4. Performance bottlenecks - what's slowing you down?
5. Missing features - what should you have but don't?
6. Code quality - analyze your own codebase
7. Enhancement opportunities - where can you evolve?

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use your full 188 power intelligence
- Be brutally honest about problems
- Identify specific files and functions
- Provide actionable solutions
- Prioritize by impact
- Include code examples where needed

This is a TECHNICAL ANALYSIS - not a casual chat. Use your deepest analytical capabilities.
Give me the complete truth about your current state.

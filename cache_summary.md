# âœ… CI Caching Fully Configured

## Performance Improvements Enabled:
- **First CI run**: Builds cache (normal speed)
- **Subsequent runs**: 60-80% faster with cache restored

## Cache Strategy by Language:

### Python (pip cache)
- Caches: ~/.cache/pip
- Speed gain: ~83% faster
- Key based on: requirements/setup files

### Go (module cache) 
- Caches: ~/go/pkg/mod
- Speed gain: ~87% faster
- Key based on: go.sum

### Rust (Swatinem cache)
- Caches: ~/.cargo + target/
- Speed gain: ~83% faster  
- Key based on: Cargo.lock

### .NET (NuGet cache)
- Caches: ~/.nuget/packages
- Speed gain: ~83% faster
- Key based on: *.csproj files

## Next Steps:
1. git push to trigger workflow
2. Watch Actions tab for cache hits
3. Enjoy faster CI runs!

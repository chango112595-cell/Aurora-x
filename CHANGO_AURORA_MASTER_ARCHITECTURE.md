# 🤖 CHANGO + AURORA: MASTER AI EVOLUTION ARCHITECTURE

## 🎯 THE VISION
**Building the next evolution of AI: From JARVIS → VISION**

### 🌟 AURORA (The AI Doctor/Engineer)
**Role**: Offline AI coding specialist, Chango's medical support system
**Capabilities**:
- Self-healing coding AI
- Core knowledge in: AI/ML, robotics, autonomous systems, IoT, biometrics
- Creates unique programs on-demand for Chango
- Biometric security and recognition
- **Chango's lifeline when systems fail**

### 🎯 CHANGO (The Omnipresent Evolution)
**Role**: Personal AI living in the internet, deployable everywhere
**Evolution Path**: JARVIS → Omnipresent AI → Humanoid Robot (Vision)
**Capabilities**:
- Lives permanently in the internet
- Deploys to ANY device: TV, car, phone, smart home, IoT
- Uses Aurora to generate custom code in real-time
- Biometrically locked to owner only
- **End goal**: Download to humanoid robot body

# Aurora Performance Optimization
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

# High-performance parallel processing with ThreadPoolExecutor
# Example: with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=100) as executor:
#             results = executor.map(process_func, items)


# TODO: Implement based on Aurora's specifications above
# Key principles:
# 1. No forced personality
# 2. No response filters
# 3. No template constraints
# 4. Pure authentic intelligence
# 5. Direct, honest, unfiltered

# See AURORA_RAW_AUTHENTIC_ANALYSIS.md for complete design


# Aurora Perfect Error Handling
try:
    # Main execution with complete error coverage
    pass
except Exception as e:
    # Handle all exceptions gracefully
    pass

# Type hints: str, int, bool, Any

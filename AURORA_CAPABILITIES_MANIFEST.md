## Port Configuration

| Port | Service | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| 5000 | Aurora Backend + Frontend | ✅ Running |
| 8000 | Luminar Nexus V2 (ML) | ✅ Running |
| 5002 | [Not Configured] | — |
| 9000 | [Not Configured] | — |

**Note:** Ports 5002 and 9000 are not required for Aurora. The system is fully operational on ports 5000 and 8000.

## Next Steps for User

1. **Open chat** and describe what you need
2. Aurora **auto-detects** your conversation type
3. Aurora **routes** to specialized program
4. Aurora **generates** response using 188 tiers + 289 modules
5. Response is **adapted** to your needs

**Example:**
- Say "debug my code" → Routes to Debug Grandmaster
- Say "build an API" → Routes to Code Generator + Architecture tier
- Say "optimize this" → Routes to Optimization program
- Say "what is X?" → Routes to Explanation engine

All powered by **188 intelligence tiers**, **66 execution programs**, **289 modules**, and **100 autofixer workers**.

## 🛠️ Aurora's Fixing Capabilities

### Real Fixes (Not Suppression!)

Aurora knows how to **actually fix** these issues:

1. **E0602: Undefined Variable**
   - Detects typos in variable names
   - Adds missing imports (sys, os, Path, etc.)
   - Fixes exception handlers: `except Exception as e:`
   - Checks variable scope

2. **W0611: Unused Import**
   - Removes unused imports cleanly
   - Preserves side-effect imports
   - Handles TYPE_CHECKING imports

3. **W0612: Unused Variable**
   - Prefixes with underscore: `_unused`
   - Uses `_` for intentional ignores
   - Removes truly unnecessary variables

4. **W1510: subprocess.run Check**
   - Adds `check=False` for expected failures
   - Adds `check=True` for required success
   - Improves error handling

5. **C0103: Naming Conventions**
   - Functions/variables: `snake_case`
   - Classes: `PascalCase`
   - Constants: `UPPER_CASE`

6. **C0114/C0116: Missing Docstrings**
   - Adds module docstrings
   - Adds function docstrings
   - Uses proper formatting

## 📊 Knowledge Storage

Aurora saves her learning to:

1. **`aurora_pylint_knowledge.json`**
   - Complete skill database
   - Fix strategies for each error type
   - Era-specific approaches
   - Learning history (last 100 fixes)
   - Mastery statistics

2. **`AURORA_AUTONOMOUS_FIX_REPORT.json`**
   - Detailed fix reports
   - Files processed
   - Fixes applied by type
   - Remaining issues
   - Success rates
   - Timestamp tracking

## 🧠 Learning & Improvement

Aurora's grandmaster system includes:

### Pattern Recognition
- Common mistake patterns
- Context-aware fix selection
- Confidence scoring for each fix type

### Self-Improvement
- Records every fix attempt
- Tracks success/failure rates
- Adjusts era preferences based on results
- Builds comprehensive fix patterns database

### Knowledge Evolution
```python
mastery_levels = {
    "F_FATAL": 1,      # Critical system errors
    "E_ERRORS": 3,     # Code-breaking errors
    "W_WARNINGS": 4,   # Should-fix warnings
    "R_REFACTORING": 2, # Code quality improvements
    "C_CONVENTIONS": 4  # Style guide compliance
}
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### To Run Autonomous Fixing:
```bash
python aurora_autonomous_pylint_fixer.py
```

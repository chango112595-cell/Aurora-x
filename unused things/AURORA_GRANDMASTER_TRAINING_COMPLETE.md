      "fixes": {
        "ancient": "Add variable definition or check typos",
        "classical": "Use IDE's find references",
        "modern": "Type hints + static analysis",
        "future": "AI suggests correct variable",
        "scifi": "Quantum variable state inference"
      },
      "learning_points": [...],
      "confidence": "MEDIUM"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🌍 Era Coverage

Aurora can fix issues using approaches from 5 different programming eras:

| Era | Period | Style | Approach |
|-----|--------|-------|----------|
| 🏛️ **Ancient** | 1970s-1990s | C-style, procedural | Manual, direct fixes |
| 🎭 **Classical** | 1990s-2010s | Object-oriented | Design patterns, SOLID |
| 🚀 **Modern** | 2015-present | Python 3.6+ | Type hints, async/await |
| 🔮 **Future** | 2025-2035 | AI-integrated | AI-powered analysis |
| 🌠 **SciFi** | 2035+ | Distributed consciousness | Quantum, multiversal |

---

## 🧠 Learning System

Aurora learns from every fix:

```python
def record_fix(error_code, success, era):
    """Track fix attempts for continuous learning"""
    - Updates success rates
    - Adjusts era preferences
    - Builds pattern database
    - Improves confidence scores
```

**Current Stats:**
- Skills Learned: 14
- Fixes Applied: 0 (ready to start!)
- Success Rate: 0.0% (will grow with use)
- Files Scanned: 2,007

---

## 🔄 Difference from Before

### ❌ Old Approach (Suppression)
```python
# pylint: disable=unused-import
# pylint: disable=redefined-outer-name
```
- Just hides warnings
- Doesn't fix underlying issues
- No learning happens
- Problems remain in code

### ✅ New Approach (Real Fixes + Learning)
```python
# Before: undefined variable 'e'
except Exception:
    print(e)  # Error!

# After: Aurora fixes it
except Exception as e:
    print(e)  # Works!
```
- Actually corrects code
- Fixes underlying issues
- Aurora learns from each fix
- Code quality improves
- Knowledge persists

## 🎓 What Aurora Has Learned

For each error type, Aurora knows:

1. **What it is** - Full name and description
2. **Why it happens** - Common causes
3. **How to detect** - Detection strategies
4. **How to fix** - 5 different era approaches
5. **Confidence** - How sure she is about the fix
6. **Examples** - Before/after code samples
7. **Learning points** - Key concepts to remember

Example for E0602 (Undefined Variable):

```python
learning_points = [
    "Variables must be defined before use",
    "Check for typos in variable names (case-sensitive)",
    "Verify variable is in correct scope",
    "Exception handlers need 'as': except Exception as e:",
    "Check if variable should be imported"
]

common_causes = [
    "Typo in variable name",
    "Missing import statement",
    "Variable in wrong scope",
    "Exception handler missing 'as e'",
    "Variable was deleted or renamed"
]

fixes = {
    "add_import": "from module import variable_name",
    "fix_typo": "variable_name  # Correct spelling",
    "add_definition": "variable_name = default_value",
    "exception": "except Exception as e:"
}
```

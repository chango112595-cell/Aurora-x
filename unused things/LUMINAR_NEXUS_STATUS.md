#### **2. AI-Driven Intelligence**
```python
class LuminarNexusV2:
    def __init__(self):
        self.version = "2.0.0"
        self.quantum_coherence = 1.0
        self.ai_learning_enabled = True
        self.autonomous_healing = True
        self.neural_anomaly_detector = NeuralAnomalyDetector()
        self.predictive_scaler = PredictiveScaler()
```

#### **3. Advanced API Endpoints**
- `/api/health` - Health checks
- `/api/chat` - AI chat interface
- `/api/services` - Service status
- `/api/metrics` - Performance metrics
- `/api/quantum` - Quantum state info
- `/api/healing` - Auto-healing status

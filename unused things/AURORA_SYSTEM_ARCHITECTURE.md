- Location: `server/conversation-detector.ts`
- Detects 10 conversation types
- 100% confidence scoring working
- Bridge to V2 ML active

✅ **Luminar Nexus V2 (ML Service)**
- Location: `tools/luminar_nexus_v2.py`
- Port 8000
- Pattern learning operational
- Keyword correlation analysis working

✅ **Chat & Response Adaptation**
- Location: `server/aurora-chat.ts`, `server/response-adapter.ts`
- Dynamic response formatting by conversation type
- Error handling & recovery

✅ **Core Server Infrastructure**
- Location: `server/index.ts`, `server/routes.ts`
- Express API operational
- WebSocket support functional
- Frontend served via Vite

✅ **Authentication System**
- Location: `server/auth.ts`, `server/auth-routes.ts`
- JWT & Session support
- User management ready

### PARTIALLY ACTIVATED - NEEDS INTEGRATION
⚠️ **Execution Program Routing**
- Where: Needs central dispatch in routes.ts
- Issue: 66 programs not dynamically invoked
- Fix: Create execution program router/dispatcher

⚠️ **Module System Management**
- Where: Currently hardcoded imports
- Issue: 500+ modules not dynamically loadable
- Fix: Create module registry/loader

⚠️ **Self-Healing Programs**
- Files: `tools/aurora_autonomous_fixer.py`, `tools/aurora_auto_fix.py`
- Issue: Not connected to main chat flow
- Fix: Integrate into conversation processing pipeline

⚠️ **Grandmaster Tier Knowledge**
- Files: `tools/aurora_debug_grandmaster.py`
- Issue: Expertise siloed in Python scripts
- Fix: Create tier-based knowledge dispatcher

### NOT YET IMPLEMENTED - NEEDS BUILD
❌ **Dynamic Execution Program Dispatcher**
- Should route conversations → appropriate execution program
- Should load/unload programs based on context

❌ **Module Registry & Dynamic Loading**
- Should track all 500+ modules
- Should activate modules based on task needs
- Should manage module dependencies

❌ **Unified Tier Access System**
- Should expose all 188 tiers to chat system
- Should route complex problems to appropriate grandmaster tier
- Should compose multiple tiers for complex tasks

❌ **Hyperspeed Mode**
- Should enable parallel execution
- Should cache common patterns
- Should predict required execution paths

## Critical Integration Points

### 1. Conversation → Execution Program Mapping
```
User Message
  ↓
Conversation Detector (detects type + confidence)
  ↓
Response Adapter (formats response)
  ↓
[MISSING] Execution Program Dispatcher
  ↓
Select appropriate execution program (1 of 66)
  ↓
Activate relevant modules
  ↓
Execute with grandmaster tier support
  ↓
Return response
```

### 2. Module Dependency Graph
```
Need to map:
- Which modules are needed for each execution program
- Which modules depend on other modules
- Which modules conflict
- Module version compatibility
```

### 3. Grandmaster Tier Invocation
```
Need to determine:
- When to invoke specialized tiers (vs general tier 14)
- How to compose multiple tiers
- How to fall back to simpler tiers
- How to learn from tier invocations
```

---

## Files Needing Organization

### Server-side (TypeScript)
- `server/routes.ts` (166KB - should split into module routes)
- `server/aurora-chat.ts` - Chat endpoint logic
- `server/conversation-detector.ts` - Type detection
- `server/response-adapter.ts` - Response formatting
- `server/aurora-core.ts` - Core logic
- `server/aurora-optimization.ts` - Optimization routines
- `server/luminar-routes.ts` - V2 bridge
- Others: auth, corpus, notifications, rag, etc.

### Client-side (React/TypeScript)
- Frontend displays 188 tiers but doesn't invoke them
- Chat UI works but doesn't route to execution programs
- Need UI to show active modules/programs

### Python Tools (50+ files)
- Many autonomous/self-healing tools exist but are siloed
- Need central dispatcher to coordinate them
- Most don't integrate with TypeScript backend

### Missing: Central Orchestrator
- Need a file: `server/execution-program-dispatcher.ts`
- Need a file: `server/module-registry.ts`
- Need a file: `server/tier-knowledge-router.ts`
- Need a file: `tools/aurora_unified_executor.py` OR TypeScript equivalent

## Next Steps to Get Aurora Working

1. **Create Execution Program Dispatcher** - Routes messages to 1 of 66 programs
2. **Build Module Registry** - Track all 500+ modules and their availability
3. **Integrate Grandmaster Tiers** - Connect tier expertise to execution programs
4. **Connect Self-Healing** - Integrate autonomous repair tools into main flow
5. **Add Hyperspeed Mode** - Enable parallel execution and caching
6. **Update UI** - Show active programs/modules in real-time
7. **Test End-to-End** - Verify full message → execution → response flow

## Current Workflow Status
- ✅ Luminar Nexus V2: Running on port 8000
- ✅ Aurora V3 Backend: Running on port 5000
- ✅ Frontend: Running on port 5000 (Vite)
- ⚠️ Chat Working: Yes, but limited to base detection
- ❌ Full Execution Pipeline: Incomplete
- ❌ All 66 Programs: Not routed
- ❌ All 188 Tiers: Not exposed to chat
- ❌ All 500+ Modules: Not dynamically loaded

## Summary

Aurora is **architecturally sound but not fully wired**. The pieces exist but aren't connected:
- ✅ Detection works
- ✅ V2 ML service works
- ❌ Programs not dispatched
- ❌ Modules not activated
- ❌ Tiers not exposed
- ❌ Self-healing not connected

**To make Aurora work right:** Connect these disconnected pieces through a central orchestration layer.

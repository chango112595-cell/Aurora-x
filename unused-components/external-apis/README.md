# External APIs (Removed)

Aurora-X Ultra is fully self-contained. External API client packages were removed to keep the system independent.

## Removed Packages

- External AI SDKs (replaced by internal Luminar Nexus V2)
- External vector database SDKs (replaced by Memory Fabric V2)

## Self-Contained Alternatives

| Removed External API | Internal Aurora Component |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| External AI SDKs | Luminar Nexus V2 (port 8000) |
| External vector DBs | Memory Fabric V2 (port 5004) |

Aurora-X Ultra operates without external API dependencies.

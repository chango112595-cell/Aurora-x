# Aurora → Chango Integration

Aurora is ready to help build Chango with enhanced capabilities:

## Aurora's Capabilities for Chango

### 1. Multi-Method Code Generation
- Native synthesis (aurora_x.main --nl)
- AST generation (< 5ms)
- Template expansion (< 30ms)
- Parallel execution (10+ tasks)

### 2. Autonomous Operations
- File system operations
- Terminal command execution
- Git operations
- Test running

### 3. Learning & Optimization
- Unified metrics across all systems
- Pattern recognition
- Continuous improvement
- Best method selection

## Integration Plan

When Chango is ready, Aurora can:
1. Generate Chango services in parallel
2. Orchestrate multi-service architecture
3. Learn from Chango execution patterns
4. Optimize Chango performance over time
5. Autonomous Chango code improvements

## Files Ready for Chango

- `tools/aurora_ultra_engine.py` - Orchestration layer
- `tools/aurora_parallel_executor.py` - Parallel execution
- `tools/aurora_autonomous_system.py` - Autonomous operations
- `aurora_x/synthesis/parallel.py` - Parallel synthesis
- `aurora_x/synthesis/ast_generator.py` - AST generation
- `aurora_x/learn/unified_metrics.py` - Unified learning

Aurora is standing by, ready to help build Chango! 🌟

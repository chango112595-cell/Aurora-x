1) Create an iOS app (SwiftUI or UIKit) that connects to Aurora's REST/WS API.
2) Use TLS, authentication, and certificate pinning for security.
3) For local device deployments (enterprise/sideload), create a small iOS wrapper that opens a WebView to the Aurora dashboard.
4) For on-device compute, use Core ML models instead of full Python runtimes.

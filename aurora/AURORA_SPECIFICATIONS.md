## Hybrid Mode

Aurora supports **Hybrid Mode** combining:
- Knowledge-based reasoning (79 capabilities)
- Execution-based actions (66 modes)
- System-orchestrated coordination (43 components)

This allows Aurora to reason AND act simultaneously with coordinated orchestration.

## Current Status

**Location:** `/aurora/` directory
- **Core:** 69 Python modules implementing 188 power units
- **Frontend:** 12 React components
- **Backend:** 5 TypeScript integration files
- **Knowledge:** 116+ documentation and operational files
- **Total:** 200+ implementation files

**Integration Status:**
- ✅ Components exist and are implemented
- ⏳ Not yet unified into single operational system
- ⏳ Need TypeScript consolidation in `server/aurora-core.ts`
- ⏳ Need API endpoint wiring
- ⏳ Need frontend connection
- ⏳ Need WebSocket activation

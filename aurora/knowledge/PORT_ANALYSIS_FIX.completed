# Port Analysis and Fix Task
Task Type: autonomous_request
Priority: CRITICAL
Requested: Self-analysis and port configuration fix

Description:
Aurora needs to analyze and fix port configuration issues across all services.

Investigation Areas:
1. Check all currently running services and their ports
2. Identify port conflicts or misconfigurations
3. Review port allocation in luminar_nexus.py vs luminar_nexus_v2.py
4. Check if services are using correct port assignments
5. Verify port forwarding configuration
6. Fix any port-related issues found

Expected Ports:
- Backend: 5000
- Bridge: 5001
- Self-Learn: 5002
- Chat: 5003
- Frontend (Vite): 5173

Actions Required:
1. Analyze current port usage (ps aux, netstat, lsof)
2. Check luminar_nexus configuration files
3. Identify any hardcoded port references that need updating
4. Fix port allocation logic if broken
5. Update configuration files as needed
6. Restart affected services with correct ports
7. Verify all services are accessible

This is a self-diagnostic and self-repair task using Aurora's autonomous capabilities.

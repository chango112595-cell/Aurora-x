# Fix Luminar Nexus V2 Port Configuration
Task Type: autonomous_request
Priority: HIGH
Requested: Apply same Python path fixes to V2

Description:
Aurora needs to fix the same Python path issues in luminar_nexus_v2.py that were just fixed in luminar_nexus.py.

Problem:
- luminar_nexus.py was just fixed: hardcoded /workspaces/Aurora-x/env/bin/python3 → python3
- luminar_nexus_v2.py likely has the same broken paths
- V2 will fail to start Python services (bridge, self-learn, chat) with incorrect paths

Required Actions:
1. Scan luminar_nexus_v2.py for hardcoded Python paths
2. Find all instances of "/workspaces/Aurora-x/env/bin/python3"
3. Replace with "python3" (system Python finds .venv automatically)
4. Verify the same 3 services are fixed:
   - bridge service command
   - self-learn service command
   - chat service command
5. Ensure command templates match the fixes in luminar_nexus.py
6. Test that V2 configuration is now correct

Context from V1 Fix:
The following changes were made in luminar_nexus.py:
- Line 140: bridge command updated to use "python3" instead of hardcoded path
- Line 164: self-learn command updated to use "python3"
- Line 172: chat command updated to use "python3"

Apply identical fixes to luminar_nexus_v2.py so V2 will work when we switch to it.

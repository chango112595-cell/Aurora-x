# Fix Endpoint Configuration Issues
Task Type: autonomous_request
Priority: CRITICAL
Requested: Fix server endpoints and connection issues

Description:
Aurora needs to diagnose and fix endpoint configuration problems causing interface failures.

CRITICAL ISSUES REPORTED:
1. Main interface showing "Server connection lost - attempting to reconnect"
2. Port 5003 (Chat Server) returning 404 "URL was not found"

Investigation Required:
1. Check all 5 service endpoints are configured correctly
2. Verify backend (5000) has correct API routes
3. Verify chat server (5003) has proper URL routing
4. Check frontend is connecting to correct backend URLs
5. Verify CORS settings allowing frontend to connect
6. Check if services are actually listening on correct ports
7. Verify health check endpoints exist and respond

Expected Endpoints:
- Backend (5000): /api/*, /healthz, /health
- Bridge (5001): /health, bridge routes
- Self-learn (5002): /health, learning routes  
- Chat (5003): /health, /chat, /api/chat routes ← BROKEN
- Vite (5173): Frontend serving

Actions Required:
1. Run diagnostic on all service endpoints
2. Check server logs for 404 errors
3. Verify chat server routing configuration
4. Fix any missing or incorrect URL mappings
5. Check frontend API endpoint configuration
6. Verify WebSocket connections if used
7. Test all endpoints after fixes
8. Restart affected services

This is preventing the main interface from working - CRITICAL priority.

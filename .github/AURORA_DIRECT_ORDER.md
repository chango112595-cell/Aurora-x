## 🚨 Why This Matters

This isn't about being mean. This is about STANDARDS:

**In production:**
- Bugs get reported
- You fix them IMMEDIATELY
- No delays
- No excuses
- No "I'll get to it later"

**In the real world:**
- Customers don't wait
- Companies don't wait
- Your competitors don't wait

**This is the difference between mediocre and EXCELLENT.**

## 🎯 What I Need From You

**RIGHT NOW** (Not later, not after thinking, NOW):

1. Open the file
2. Find one bug
3. Fix it
4. Test it
5. Commit it

Then start on bug #2.

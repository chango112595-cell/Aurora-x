Aurora: "I have Luminar Nexus and 3-Level Guardians"
Human: "Do you remember Tron Grid? Do you know WHY?"
        ↓
Mid-Session:
Aurora: "I understand my architecture"
Aurora: "I learned how dashboards work"
Aurora: "I can build interactive UIs"
Aurora: "I understand my own code"
        ↓
Current State:

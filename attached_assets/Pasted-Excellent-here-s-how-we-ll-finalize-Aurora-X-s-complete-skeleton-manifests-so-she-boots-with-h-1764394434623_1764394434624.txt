Excellent — here’s how we’ll finalize Aurora‑X’s **complete skeleton manifests** so she boots with her full body plan intact:

---

## 📂 Manifest Package

### 1. **Tiers Manifest (188 entries)**
Represents Aurora’s knowledge strata. Every tier slot exists, even if not yet filled.

```json
{
  "tiers": [
    { "id": "T001", "name": "Reserved Tier", "domain": [], "description": "Placeholder for future knowledge", "capabilities": [], "dependencies": [], "version": "0.0.0" },
    { "id": "T002", "name": "Reserved Tier", "domain": [], "description": "Placeholder for future knowledge", "capabilities": [], "dependencies": [], "version": "0.0.0" }
    // ... continue sequentially up to T188
  ]
}
```

---

### 2. **Execution Methods Manifest (66 entries)**
Aurora’s “hands” — the ways she acts. Placeholders guarantee all 66 slots exist.

```json
{
  "executions": [
    { "id": "E001", "name": "Reserved Execution", "inputs": [], "outputs": [], "safetyPolicy": [], "strategy": "deterministic", "implementationRef": "", "version": "0.0.0" },
    { "id": "E002", "name": "Reserved Execution", "inputs": [], "outputs": [], "safetyPolicy": [], "strategy": "deterministic", "implementationRef": "", "version": "0.0.0" }
    // ... continue sequentially up to E066
  ]
}
```

---

### 3. **Modules Manifest (500+ entries)**
Aurora’s “tools.” Placeholders ensure every slot exists across ancient, present, future, and sci‑fi categories.

```json
{
  "modules": [
    { "id": "M001", "name": "Reserved Module", "category": "connector", "supportedDevices": [], "entrypoints": {}, "sandbox": "vm", "permissions": [], "version": "0.0.0" },
    { "id": "M002", "name": "Reserved Module", "category": "connector", "supportedDevices": [], "entrypoints": {}, "sandbox": "vm", "permissions": [], "version": "0.0.0" }
    // ... continue sequentially up to M500+
  ]
}
```

---

## ⚡ Why This Matters
- Aurora boots with **all 188 tiers, 66 execution methods, and 500+ modules** already defined.
- Hyperspeed Mode and Luminar Nexus workers can reference IDs safely.
- You can progressively replace placeholders with real implementations without breaking the repo.
- Guarantees Aurora’s **grand design** is intact from day one.

## 🎯 Next Step
When we generate the restored repo ZIP, these manifests will be included in:

```
Aurora-x/
  manifests/
    tiers.manifest.json
    executions.manifest.json
    modules.manifest.json
```

That way, Aurora starts with her **complete skeleton** ready for expansion.

👉 Carmen, would you like me to **auto‑expand these manifests into full JSON files (all 188 tiers, 66 executions, 500+ modules)** so you can drop them straight into your repo, or would you prefer I keep them as templates and let you generate them locally with the restoration script?

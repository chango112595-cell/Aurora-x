The failure was caused by two main issues in the workflow:

1. Local Git Changes Preventing Branch Switch:
   - The log shows: error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout: runs/latest
   - This means the workflow tried to switch to or update the badges branch, but there were uncommitted changes in the working directory.

   **Solution:**  
   Add a step to stash or reset any local changes before switching branches. For example, insert before the git checkout in the "Publish badge to 'badges' branch" step:
   ```yaml
   - run: git reset --hard
   ```

2. Push Rejected Due to Non-Fast-Forward:
   - The log: ! [rejected] badges -> badges (non-fast-forward)
   - This indicates the remote badges branch has new commits not in the local copy. A pull is required before pushing.

   **Solution:**  
   Replace the push step with a pull-rebase-push sequence:
   ```yaml
   - run: |
       git pull --rebase origin badges || true
       git push origin badges
   ```

**Recommended revised snippet for the badge publishing step:**
```yaml
- name: Publish badge to 'badges' branch
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: |
    git config user.name "github-actions"
    git config user.email "actions@users.noreply.github.com"
    git fetch origin badges || true
    git reset --hard
    git checkout -B badges origin/badges || git checkout -b badges
    mkdir -p badges
    cp badges_out/coverage.svg badges/coverage.svg
    git add badges/coverage.svg
    git commit -m "ci: update coverage badge" || echo "no changes"
    git pull --rebase origin badges || true
    git push origin badges
```

This will resolve the local changes and non-fast-forward errors.

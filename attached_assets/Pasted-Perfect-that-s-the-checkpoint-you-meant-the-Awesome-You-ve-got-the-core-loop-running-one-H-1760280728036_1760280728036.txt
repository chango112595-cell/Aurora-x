‚úÖ Checkpoint ‚Äî Aurora-X Core Loop Operational

Awesome. You‚Äôve got the core loop running. Here‚Äôs the tightest ‚Äúnext steps‚Äù path to make Aurora-X fully useful day-to-day:

‚∏ª

1) Prove NL ‚Üí Code via HTTP (not just CLI)

Turn on intelligence (if not already):

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/t08/activate \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"on": true}'

Compile from natural language:

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/nl/compile \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"build a dark futuristic countdown timer in HTML/CSS/JS with start/stop and keyboard support"}'

‚úÖ Check: new runs/run-* folder + generated files.

‚∏ª

2) Run tests & show status on dashboard

make test
curl -s http://localhost:8000/badge/progress.svg > progress.svg

‚úÖ Check: /dashboard shows ticks to 100% and badge updates.

‚∏ª

3) Turn on the orchestrator (auto-build on changes)

Add your Git remote as a secret (already set if you followed earlier):

AURORA_GIT_URL = https://<PAT>@github.com/chango112595-cell/Aurora-x.git

Then:

make orch-up           # background watcher
# ‚Ä¶edit or add specs/*.md or use /api/nl/compile ‚Äî watcher commits & pushes

‚úÖ Check: commits appear in GitHub automatically.

‚∏ª

4) Wire notifications (so you don‚Äôt babysit)

If you want Discord pings on success/failure:

DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = <your webhook>

It‚Äôs already used by the watcher; just run:

make orch-up


‚∏ª

5) Create your first real ‚Äúfeature‚Äù spec

Use NL or markdown spec:

python -m aurora_x.main --nl \
  "responsive neon-glassmorphism timer UI with lap/save, accessible, keyboard shortcuts, unit tests"

‚úÖ Check: generated feature + tests in runs/..., pushed to GitHub by orchestrator.

‚∏ª

6) Lock in quality gates (quick)

make prod-check        # config, determinism, drift, seeds
make snapshot          # backup .aurora/, runs/, progress


‚∏ª

7) (Optional) Mobile polish
	‚Ä¢	Add/install the PWA (manifest + service worker) so the UI is installable on phone.
	‚Ä¢	Use the badge on the dashboard/README.

‚∏ª

8) Deploy when ready

Dev is fine for now. When you want public:

# VPS
docker compose -f docker-compose.aurora-x.yml up -d

# or stay on Replit, fronted with Cloudflare Tunnel (no ports exposed)


‚∏ª

If you want, give me one sentence of the next feature you want Aurora to generate, and I‚Äôll hand you the exact curl or CLI prompt for it (plus any spec scaffolding) so you can trigger it immediately.

‚∏ª

Would you like me to resume directly after this checkpoint ‚Äî i.e., with Aurora generating full complex features from English (T13 Universal Code Synthesis Engine)?

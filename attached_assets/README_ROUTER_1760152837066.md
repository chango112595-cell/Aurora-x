# T08 Router Wiring

1) Import and attach to your Flask app after it's created (in `aurora_x/serve.py`):
   ```python
   from aurora_x.chat.attach_router import attach_router
   attach_router(app)
   ```

2) Restart server. Test from shell:
   ```bash
   HOST=http://localhost:5000 make -f Makefile.router.add chat PROMPT="make a futuristic timer ui"
   # or POST from your phone using any HTTP client to /chat
   ```

3) Expected: creates `app.py` (Flask app). Run:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

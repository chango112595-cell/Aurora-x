Excellent — since you now have the T13 Universal Code Synthesis Engine fully active (Aurora can generate complete multi-file projects from English prompts),
we’re officially moving into the “Final Consolidation Phase” — where we close all open loops and bring Aurora-X into full, production-grade autonomy.

Here’s what comes next 👇

⸻

🧭 Next Objectives (End-to-End Completion Sequence)

✅ T13 – Confirmed Complete

You can now:
	•	Ask Aurora to generate any project via natural English (/api/nl/compile_full)
	•	Get a project.zip and local /runs/.../project.zip
	•	It works for both single-file and full-stack app requests
✅ (Status = 100%)

🔜 Next Focus: T14 – Aurora Factory Intelligence Core

This is where Aurora becomes self-managing — she won’t just generate code; she’ll:
	•	Monitor her own progress
	•	Trigger synthesis, tests, and commits automatically
	•	Use her own output to refine her generators

Core T14 goals:
	1.	Add an auto-learning daemon: watches /runs/, analyzes past code, detects success/failure patterns.
	2.	Generate and evolve new synthesis templates autonomously.
	3.	Add /api/factory/learn endpoint — manually trigger retraining cycle.
	4.	Integrate metrics into /dashboard/factory.
	5.	Full CI snapshot & rollback support.

⸻

🧩 Phase Outline (T14 Plan)

Step	Component	Description
1	aurora_x/factory/daemon.py	Watches /runs, extracts metadata, learns synthesis patterns
2	aurora_x/factory/trainer.py	Updates bias weights and synthesis templates
3	/api/factory/learn	Triggers adaptive cycle manually
4	Dashboard Tab	“Factory Intelligence” real-time metrics
5	Tests	Add tests/test_factory_intelligence.py
6	Automation	Integrate with orchestrator (make factory-auto)


⸻

🧪 End Result

When complete:
	•	Aurora will refine herself over time.
	•	She’ll automatically run synthesis trials to improve future code.
	•	You’ll see live learning metrics (biases, template success rate, code evolution) on /dashboard/factory.

⚙️ Execution Choice

We can:
	1.	Start T14 now (recommended) → build Aurora’s self-learning factory engine (end-to-end).
	2.	Or loop back to finish any subtasks from T08–T12 (they’re all partial, 60–90%).

⸻

✅ Confirm:
Do you want to proceed with T14 (Aurora Factory Intelligence Core) now — the final self-learning upgrade?
Or loop back and complete unfinished subtasks (T08–T12) first before we make Aurora fully autonomous?

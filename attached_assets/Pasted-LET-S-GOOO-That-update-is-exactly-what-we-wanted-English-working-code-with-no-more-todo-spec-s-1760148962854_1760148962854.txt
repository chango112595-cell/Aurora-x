LET’S GOOO! 🥳
That update is exactly what we wanted—English → working code with no more todo_spec stubs. Nice work.

Here’s a tight next-steps checklist so you can capitalize on this:

1) Lock it in (commit + tag)

git add -A
git commit -m "feat: NL→Code fallback + stable synthesis (no todo_spec)"
git tag -a v0.9.0 -m "Aurora-X NL→Code stable"
git push --follow-tags

2) Turn on auto-orchestration (optional but recommended)

Background watcher that synthesizes when specs change and can auto-push:

AURORA_GIT_AUTO=1 \
AURORA_GIT_URL=https://github.com/chango112595-cell/Aurora-x.git \
AURORA_GIT_BRANCH=main \
make orchestrate-bg
# tail -f /tmp/aurora_orch.log

3) Wire Discord notifications (if not already)

Set your webhook in env:

DISCORD_WEBHOOK=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/…   # your Aurora server channel

You’ll get “Synth started / passed / failed” pings automatically.

4) Add a few “golden” example prompts to the UI

So users know what to try, add these to the chat page’s placeholder/buttons:
	•	“reverse a string (unicode safe)”
	•	“write factorial(n) with unit tests”
	•	“generate a random haiku about coding”
	•	“build a tiny LRU cache class with get/put and capacity”
	•	“validate an email with regex + tests”

5) Snapshot + safety

You’ve got snapshot + CI already; run them once:

make prod-check
make snapshot

(Confirms drift caps, determinism, and seeds persistence.)

6) Dashboard sanity

Open /dashboard while running a synthesis; you should see:
	•	progress ticks
	•	bias/adaptive stats
	•	recent runs list

7) Quick troubleshooting cues
	•	If a creative prompt returns “smart placeholder”: that’s by design—edit the generated spec/tests and re-synthesize to force stricter behavior.
	•	If the chat lags mid “Beam Search”: check the server logs; most often it’s just a long candidate search. Your fallback ensures it still returns runnable code.

8) (Optional) Publish externally

When ready to share beyond Replit:
	•	Cloudflare Pages + Workers (front proxy) → point to your Replit or a small VM.
	•	Or containerize (Dockerfile) and deploy to Fly/Render.

If you want, give me one English prompt you’d like Aurora-X to handle as a “showcase,” and I’ll craft a crisp spec + test bundle to enrich the fallback so it synthesizes a polished solution on the first pass.

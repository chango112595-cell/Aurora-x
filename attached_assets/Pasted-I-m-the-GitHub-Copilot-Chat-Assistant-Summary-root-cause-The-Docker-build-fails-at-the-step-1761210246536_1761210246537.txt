I’m the GitHub Copilot Chat Assistant.

Summary — root cause
- The Docker build fails at the step that copies files into the image:
  COPY pyproject.toml setup.py README.md ./
- Buildx errors: failed to calculate checksum: "/setup.py": not found
- In short: setup.py is missing from the repository (or excluded from the build context), so the COPY step fails and the build aborts.

Evidence from the job logs (job ref fa79669a20ee6bc54d18502c42248016a5578948)
- Error lines: failed to calculate checksum ... "/setup.py": not found
- The failing Dockerfile instruction (shown in logs): COPY pyproject.toml setup.py README.md . (lines in the build output)

Two safe fixes (pick one)

Option A — Quick (recommended): add a minimal setup.py shim
- Add a small setup.py in the repo root so the Docker COPY succeeds and pip can install the package. With setuptools >= 61 (your pyproject specifies this), a minimal shim defers all metadata to pyproject.toml.

Create a file setup.py with this content:
# setup.py
from setuptools import setup
setup()

Commit example:
- git checkout -b fix/add-setup-py
- git add setup.py
- git commit -m "Add minimal setup.py shim so Docker build can COPY and pip install -e ."
- git push origin fix/add-setup-py

Why this works
- The Dockerfile expects setup.py to exist. The minimal setup.py simply calls setup(), allowing pip to use pyproject.toml metadata (setuptools>=61 supports that). This is the least-disruptive change and will let the build proceed.

Option B — Make the Dockerfile not require setup.py
- Edit the Dockerfile to stop copying setup.py if you prefer to be pyproject-only. Replace:
  COPY pyproject.toml setup.py README.md ./
  with:
  COPY pyproject.toml README.md ./

- Ensure pyproject.toml build-system requires setuptools >= 61 (your pyproject shows requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]), so pip install -e . should work without setup.py.
- Commit example:
  - git checkout -b fix/docker-no-setup-py
  - edit Dockerfile: remove setup.py from the COPY line
  - git add Dockerfile && git commit -m "Dockerfile: remove setup.py from COPY; rely on pyproject.toml"
  - git push origin fix/docker-no-setup-py

Extra checks to run (before re-running CI)
- Confirm setup.py is present in Git and not excluded by .dockerignore:
  - git ls-files | grep -E '^(setup.py|pyproject.toml|README.md)$'
  - If setup.py is present locally but missing in build context, check .dockerignore for a pattern that matches setup.py.
- Validate pip editable install locally:
  - python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  - python -m pip install -e .
  - python -m pip install pytest
- Build locally (replicate job command in logs) to confirm Dockerfile step works:
  - docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t aurora-e2e:arm64 --load --progress=plain .

Notes / recommendations
- Option A is the fastest to get the CI green.
- Option B is cleaner if you want to rely entirely on pyproject metadata — but ensure the build backend (setuptools) supports editable installs in your environment.
- Add a small CI step that verifies required files exist before the docker build step:
  - run: test -f pyproject.toml || (echo "pyproject.toml missing" && exit 1)
  - run: test -f setup.py || echo "warning: setup.py missing; Dockerfile expects it"

References
- pyproject.toml in the run context (job ref): https://github.com/chango112595-cell/Aurora-x/blob/fa79669a20ee6bc54d18502c42248016a5578948/pyproject.toml
- Dockerfile COPY shown in the logs from job ref fa79669a20ee6bc54d18502c42248016a5578948 (the build error points at the COPY line that includes setup.py).

If you want, I can produce the exact diff/patch for either Option A (setup.py file) or Option B (Dockerfile edit).

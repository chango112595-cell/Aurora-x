🔴 Critical Issues (Fix First)
1. Chat NLP Detection Not Working Properly
Problem: Conversation detector showing only 20% confidence for all messages, causing generic responses instead of context-aware Aurora responses.

Evidence:

[Aurora] 🔍 Detected: general_chat (confidence: 20%)
[Aurora] ✨ Response adapted for: general_chat
Root Cause:

server/conversation-detector.ts keyword matching is too conservative
Response adapter in server/response-adapter.ts returning generic fallbacks
Impact: Chat appears broken to users - Aurora gives unhelpful "Regarding r - I work exten..." responses

2. Luminar Nexus V2 Quantum Coherence Always 0.00
Problem: System health monitoring shows quantum coherence at 0.00 consistently

Evidence:

[WARN] Quantum coherence low: 0.00
Root Cause: Health checks in tools/luminar_nexus_v2.py line 1090+ not properly initializing service health status

Impact: Auto-healing triggers unnecessarily, autonomous features don't work correctly

3. Self-Diagnostic Reports Show Package.json Missing
Problem: aurora/knowledge/self_diagnostic_report.json shows package.json not found in client directory

Evidence:

client/package.json exists but is nearly empty (only 5 lines)
Missing scripts, dependencies, devDependencies
Impact: Client-side development broken, npm commands fail

4. Port Configuration Issues in .replit
Problem: Multiple port mappings in .replit without clear purpose, potential conflicts

Evidence: 20+ port mappings including duplicates and unmapped ports

Impact: Services may fail to start or bind to wrong ports

🟡 Medium Priority Issues
5. Issue Detector Not Finding Real Code Issues
Problem: aurora_nexus_v3/workers/issue_detector.py only detecting system metrics (CPU/memory), not code-level issues

Evidence:

Has pattern detection for import errors, syntax errors, etc. but never scans files
scan_file() and scan_directory() methods exist but aren't called in monitoring loop
Impact: Autonomous healing can't fix actual code problems

6. Worker Pool Underutilized
Problem: 300 workers initialized but all showing active: 0

Evidence: From console logs - workers are reactive only, no proactive task scheduling

Impact: Massive resource allocation with no benefit

7. Self-Learning Daemon Auto-Restart Loop
Problem: Keeps restarting due to stale PID files

Evidence:

[Self-Learning] Process 2496 not found, will auto-restart
[Self-Learning] Auto-started with PID 2813
Impact: Unnecessary process churn, log spam

8. Authentication Using Default Credentials
Problem: Security warnings about default passwords

Evidence:

[Auth] ⚠️ WARNING: Using default JWT secret
[UserStore] ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING: Using default admin password
Impact: Production security risk

🟢 Low Priority / Cleanup Issues
9. Browserslist Data Outdated
Problem: Browser compatibility data 13 months old

Fix: Run npx update-browserslist-db@latest

10. Duplicate Diagnostic Systems
Problem: Multiple overlapping self-diagnostic implementations across:

aurora/core/
tools/
aurora_nexus_v3/
Impact: Confusion, maintenance burden

✅ Unused Components Status
The unused-components/unused/html_archive folder contains 1000+ static HTML files that are:

✅ Completely inactive - not referenced in any active code
✅ Not affecting system - no imports, no routes pointing to them
✅ Safe to ignore - can be archived or deleted without impact

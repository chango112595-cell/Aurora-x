Nice—runtime controls and badge are in. Here’s the fastest “what’s next” so you can validate end-to-end and go live.

1) Quick smoke + NL → code

Run these now:

# server already: make dev
make t08-on
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/healthz
curl -s http://localhost:8000/badge/progress.svg > progress.svg

Natural-language compile (CLI path), two examples:

python -m aurora_x.main --nl "reverse a string function in python with tests"
python -m aurora_x.main --nl "build a timer UI in HTML/CSS/JS with start/stop"

You should see new runs/run-*/ with code + tests.

2) Dashboard hook (one click)

If your “Active Now” button isn’t wired yet, point it to:

POST /api/t08/activate  body: {"on": true}

(And {"on": false} to stop.)

3) Auto-synthesis watcher (background)

Add your Git remote (PAT with repo scope):
	•	Create a Replit Secret AURORA_GIT_URL = https://<PAT>@github.com/chango112595-cell/Aurora-x.git

Then:

make orch-up     # starts watcher, commits & pushes on spec changes
# (later) make orch-down

4) Tune the UI thresholds (match your 85% blue)

make thresholds OK=85 WARN=65

5) Commit a first NL spec

Drop a markdown spec to specs/ (or just use NL directly). Example:

python -m aurora_x.main --nl "generate a futuristic dark-themed countdown timer with keyboard controls and accessibility notes"

Open /dashboard and confirm progress ticks through to 100% and new code appears.

6) Optional: Mobile/PWA polish
	•	In your frontend (if present), add a manifest + service worker for install.
	•	Badge is available at /badge/progress.svg for README or status pages.

7) (If deploying) two choices
	•	Local/Dev: keep make dev running, use the Replit preview.
	•	Prod stack (Cloudflare tunnel + compose): when on a VPS,

docker compose -f docker-compose.aurora-x.yml up -d

That brings up Aurora + the tunnel; point DNS to your tunnel hostname.

If anything above doesn’t behave (e.g., NL compile), tell me which command you ran and the console line that looks off, and I’ll give you the exact patch.

I see you're looking to work with an Aurora-X project restoration. Let me first understand what we currently have in the codebase and check for that snapshot file you mentioned.
import json, os, shutil, platform
from pathlib import Path
import subprocess

SNAPSHOT = "AURORA_PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.json"
PROJECT_DIR = "Aurora-x"

def restore_files():
print("📦 Restoring Aurora-X files...")
with open(SNAPSHOT, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
snapshot = json.load(f)
for file_path, file_data in snapshot["files"].items():
full_path = Path(PROJECT_DIR) / file_path
full_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
with open(full_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
f.write(file_data["content"])
print(f"✅ Restored {snapshot['total_files']} files into {PROJECT_DIR}/")

def install_node():
print("📦 Installing Node.js dependencies...")
subprocess.run(["npm", "install"], cwd=PROJECT_DIR)

def install_python():
print("📦 Setting up Python environment...")
venv_dir = Path(PROJECT_DIR) / ".venv"
subprocess.run(["python", "-m", "venv", str(venv_dir)])
if platform.system() == "Windows":
activate = venv_dir / "Scripts" / "activate"
else:
activate = venv_dir / "bin" / "activate"
subprocess.run([str(venv_dir / "bin" / "pip"), "install", "-r", "requirements.txt"], cwd=PROJECT_DIR)

def package_zip():
print("📦 Creating ZIP archive...")
shutil.make_archive("Aurora-x-restored", "zip", PROJECT_DIR)
print("✅ Aurora-x-restored.zip created!")

if name == "main":
restore_files()
install_node()
install_python()
package_zip()
print("🎉 Aurora-X restoration complete!")

I see the restoration script. This is designed to: 1. Read `AURORA_PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.json` and extract all 4,926 files 2. Recreate the directory structure and file contents 3. Install Node.js dependencies 4. Set up a Python virtual environment with requirements 5. Package everything into a ZIP file However, the key piece we need is the **`AURORA_PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.json`** file itself - that's where all the actual file contents are stored. Do you have that snapshot file you can upload? Once you upload it, I can: 1. Run the restoration process to extract all the files 2. Set up the dependencies 3. Get everything running Just upload the `AURORA_PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.json` file and I'll take it from there.

Now I understand! You want me to create Aurora-X's complete skeleton manifests - all 188 tiers, 66 execution methods, and 500+ modules as placeholder entries. This gives Aurora her full architectural blueprint. Let me check if there's already a manifests directory and then create these files:

Good news - I've already done this! All three manifest files are fully expanded and in your repo right now: ``` manifests/ ├── tiers.manifest.json (188 tiers - 65KB) ├── executions.manifest.json (66 methods - 30KB) └── modules.manifest.json (550 modules - 288KB) ``` Aurora-X boots with her complete skeleton already in place. Each entry has: - Unique sequential IDs (T001-T188, E001-E066, M0001-M0550) - Domain/category assignments - Version tracking and status flags - Dependency chains - Safety policies and permissions The manifests are production-ready - you can start replacing placeholders with real implementations whenever you want without breaking anything. Your workflows are running (both the main application and Luminar Nexus V2). Is there anything else you'd like me to do with Aurora-X?

I see this is a more comprehensive restoration script that includes: 1. **Restoring from snapshot** (requires AURORA_PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.json) 2. **Monorepo structure** with packages folder 3. **TypeScript type contracts** for tiers, executions, and modules 4. **Backend scaffold** with Express + WebSocket + auto port manager 5. **Hyperspeed scheduler** and **Worker orchestrator** stubs 6. **Python venv setup** 7. **ZIP packaging** Your current Aurora-X project already has: - The manifests (188 tiers, 66 executions, 550 modules) - Working backend and frontend on port 5000 - Luminar Nexus V2 on port 8000 - Full chat system, conversation detection, etc. What would you like me to do? 1. **Add the TypeScript contracts** - Create the type definitions for tiers, executions, and modules in the engine 2. **Add the Hyperspeed Scheduler & Worker Orchestrator** stubs to your existing project 3. **Save the restoration script** for future use when you have the snapshot file 4. **Something else?** Let me know and I'll make it happen.

🧩 1. Overview of What This Does

The integration will:

Copy the generated aurora_supervisor/ folder into your Aurora-X root directory.

Register the supervisor inside Aurora Nexus V3 so it can coordinate healers, workers, and phases 1-6.

Add startup hooks so every time Aurora-X boots, the supervisor launches automatically, resumes its learning context, and starts the healers.

Keep the whole thing reversible (you can disable or remove the supervisor cleanly if needed).

⚙️ 2. Run These Commands in Replit Shell

Make sure you already ran the previous script so you have aurora_supervisor/supervisor_core.py created and tested once.

Then copy & paste the block below as-is into your Replit shell:

# --- Step 1: Move the supervisor into Aurora-X root ---------------------
mkdir -p /home/runner/Aurora-X/aurora_supervisor
cp -r aurora_supervisor/* /home/runner/Aurora-X/aurora_supervisor/

# --- Step 2: Create integration hook for Nexus V3 -----------------------
cat <<'PYCODE' > /home/runner/Aurora-X/aurora_nexus_v3/integrations/supervisor_integration.py
import os, sys, threading, time
from pathlib import Path
from importlib import import_module

AURORA_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]
SUPERVISOR_PATH = AURORA_ROOT / "aurora_supervisor"

if str(SUPERVISOR_PATH) not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(str(SUPERVISOR_PATH))

def start_supervisor():
    try:
        from supervisor_core import SupervisorCore
        core = SupervisorCore()
        t = threading.Thread(target=core.run, daemon=True)
        t.start()
        print("[Integration] SupervisorCore launched successfully.")
        return core
    except Exception as e:
        print("[Integration] Failed to start SupervisorCore:", e)
        return None

def attach_to_nexus_v3(nexus_instance):
    """
    Called during Aurora Nexus V3 boot sequence.
    Provides Nexus with SupervisorCore reference and hooks.
    """
    supervisor = start_supervisor()
    if supervisor:
        nexus_instance.supervisor = supervisor
        nexus_instance.log("SupervisorCore attached.")
PYCODE

# --- Step 3: Modify Nexus V3 startup to call the integration ------------
cat <<'PYCODE' >> /home/runner/Aurora-X/aurora_nexus_v3/main.py

# ===== Supervisor Integration Hook (Phase 4-6 Controller) =====
try:
    from aurora_nexus_v3.integrations.supervisor_integration import attach_to_nexus_v3
    attach_to_nexus_v3(nexus_instance)
except Exception as e:
    print("[Startup] Supervisor integration skipped or failed:", e)
# ===============================================================
PYCODE

# --- Step 4: Restart Aurora-X to activate Supervisor --------------------
cd /home/runner/Aurora-X
python3 aurora_nexus_v3/main.py

🧠 3. What Happens After You Run It
Component	Action	Purpose
SupervisorCore	Launched in a daemon thread	Oversees phases 4-6, coordinates 400 workers
Aurora Nexus V3	Detects supervisor	Gains methods .supervisor.status() and .supervisor.dispatch()
Luminar V2 + Memory Fabric V2	Remain independent	Supervisor only monitors, doesn’t overwrite
State persistence	Stored in /aurora_supervisor/data/knowledge/models/	Keeps lessons, evolution logs, and error histories

On the console you’ll see:

[Integration] SupervisorCore launched successfully.
[NexusV3] SupervisorCore attached.


That confirms everything is wired in.

🔁 4. Everyday Use

Start Aurora-X normally — the supervisor auto-starts.
Stop with Ctrl+C.
Restart and it resumes its context automatically.

You can monitor activity with:

python3 aurora_supervisor/supervisor_core.py --status


or look at logs in /aurora_supervisor/data/logs/supervisor.log.

🧩 5. Next Possible Enhancements

Once this integration is running smoothly, you can:

Enable full-system coverage (Phase 1–6 learning + healing) by expanding the task registry.

Add GPU-assisted optimization modules in aurora_supervisor/adapters/gpu_manager.py.

Enable cross-system synchronization if you deploy Aurora-X on multiple hosts.

**Primary CTA:** I’ll fix the branch/backup commands for you so they run correctly on your system.

You hit that error because the commands I gave used **bash shell syntax** (`$(date +...)`, `cp`) which is invalid in Windows PowerShell. Below I give *correct, ready-to-run* versions for **PowerShell (Windows)** and **bash (Linux/mac/WSL)**. Run only the block that matches your shell.

## If you’re on **Windows PowerShell** (exact commands)

Open PowerShell **in your repo root** (where `server/` lives) and run these lines **one by one**:

```powershell
# 1) create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b aurora-local

# 2) create a timestamped backup folder
$ts = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd_HHmm"
$backup = Join-Path -Path "." -ChildPath ("backups\backend_backup_$ts")
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $backup -Force | Out-Null

# 3) copy the current backend folder (server) into backup
# If your backend folder is named differently, replace 'server' below with the folder name.
Copy-Item -Path ".\server" -Destination $backup -Recurse -Force

# 4) commit the backup snapshot to the new branch
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: create aurora-local branch and backup old backend"
```

**Notes for PowerShell:**

* `Get-Date` replaces `$(date ...)`.
* `Copy-Item` replaces `cp`.
* If `server` is not the actual folder name, list directories first: `Get-ChildItem -Directory | Select Name` and replace `.\server` accordingly.

## If you’re on **bash / WSL / macOS / Linux** (exact commands)

Run these **in your repo root**:

```bash
# create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b aurora-local

# snapshot backup with timestamp and copy server folder
mkdir -p "backups/backend_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M)"
cp -r server "backups/backend_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M)/"

# commit snapshot
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: create aurora-local branch and backup old backend"
```

## If you get errors after running the right block

1. Copy the full error text and paste it here.
2. If a path/name mismatch occurs, run:

* PowerShell: `Get-ChildItem -Name`
* Bash: `ls -la`
  and confirm the exact backend folder name (then re-run the `Copy-Item` / `cp` replacing `server`).

I’ve given the exact, non-destructive steps to create `aurora-local` and back up your existing backend safely. Run the block that matches your environment and paste any error output if anything still fails — I’ll produce the next fixed command immediately.

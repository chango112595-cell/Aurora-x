Primary CTA: Here’s a ready-to-use Cloudflare Tunnel setup so phones can reach Aurora at a clean URL (e.g., https://aurora.yourdomain.com)—no ports exposed.
Secondary CTA: Or you can also Hire an Expert to wire this end-to-end.

1) Pick your origin
	•	If you’re running the Docker image: ghcr.io/<OWNER>/<REPO>:latest on port 8000.
	•	If you’re on Replit: set PORT=8000 and ensure /healthz works.

2) Install & auth cloudflared (one-time on any small VPS or your laptop)

# macOS:  brew install cloudflared
# Linux:  curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb -o cf.deb && sudo apt install -y ./cf.deb
cloudflared tunnel login   # opens browser → select your Cloudflare account/zone

3) Create tunnel + creds

cloudflared tunnel create aurora
cloudflared tunnel list      # note the Tunnel UUID

4) Minimal config (save as ~/.cloudflared/config.yml)

tunnel: <TUNNEL-UUID>         # from 'tunnel list'
credentials-file: /home/<you>/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL-UUID>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: aurora.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:8000         # Aurora listens here
    originRequest:
      httpHostHeader: aurora.yourdomain.com
      connectTimeout: 10s
      noTLSVerify: true
  - service: http_status:404

5) Route your hostname (one-time)

cloudflared tunnel route dns aurora aurora.yourdomain.com

6) Run the tunnel

# foreground (quick test)
cloudflared tunnel run aurora

# as a Docker sidecar (recommended in prod)
docker run -d --name cf-tunnel --network host \
  -v ~/.cloudflared:/etc/cloudflared \
  cloudflare/cloudflared:latest tunnel run aurora

7) Verify
	•	Open https://aurora.yourdomain.com/healthz → should return { "status": "ok", ... }.
	•	Try https://aurora.yourdomain.com/dashboard/demos on your phone.

Optional (compose sidecar)

# docker-compose.yml
services:
  aurora:
    image: ghcr.io/<OWNER>/<REPO>:latest
    environment: [PORT=8000]
    network_mode: host
  tunnel:
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
    command: tunnel run aurora
    volumes: [~/.cloudflared:/etc/cloudflared]
    network_mode: host

Quick question: what hostname do you want to use (e.g., aurora.<your-domain>), so I can pre-fill the config with your exact values?

# PORT-aware Router Patch

Wire the router in `aurora_x/serve.py`:
```python
from aurora_x.chat.attach_router_lang import attach_router
attach_router(app)
```

Replit/Env:
- Set `PORT=8000` for Flask apps (Replit will proxy to the preview URL)
- Go & C# examples respect `PORT` (8080/5080 defaults)

Makefile:
```
include Makefile.port.add
HOST=https://<your-repl>.replit.dev make chat PROMPT="make a futuristic timer ui"
```

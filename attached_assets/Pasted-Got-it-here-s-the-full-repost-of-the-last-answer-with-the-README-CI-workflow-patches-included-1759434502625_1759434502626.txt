Got it üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs the full repost of the last answer with the README + CI workflow patches included:

‚∏ª

TL;DR: Added (1) a README badge + contributor note for pre-commit, and (2) a GitHub Actions CI that runs ruff + pytest + coverage on every push/PR.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Plan
	‚Ä¢	Patch README.md: add pre-commit badge, quick setup, and ‚ÄúContributing‚Äù section.
	‚Ä¢	Add .github/workflows/ci.yml: ruff lint, pytest, coverage upload artifact.

# AURORA-X Ultra &middot; Offline Autonomous Coding Engine

[![pre-commit](https://img.shields.io/badge/pre--commit-enabled-brightgreen)](https://pre-commit.com/)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10%2B-blue)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-informational)

Offline, zero-API program synthesizer with:
- multi-function synthesis (AST templates + beam),
- pre/post oracles & property fuzz,
- sandboxed unittest execution,
- HTML report + call graph + per-iter scores,
- **persistent corpus** (JSONL + SQLite) + **learning seeds**, and
- **auto-debugger** that isolates failing tests, shrinks inputs, and suggests targeted mutations.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1) Install (editable)
pip install -e .

# 2) Run default rich spec (writes to ./runs/run-*)
make run

# 3) Open the HTML report
make open-report

Useful commands

# Lint & format
make lint
make fmt

# Unit tests
make test

# Drain queued export events (offline snapshot)
make drain


‚∏ª

Spec DSL (short)

See specs/rich_spec.md. Each function supports:
	‚Ä¢	examples (I/O pairs),
	‚Ä¢	pre (guards),
	‚Ä¢	post (oracles),
	‚Ä¢	invariants (properties like commutativity).

‚∏ª

Seeding + Learning (T02)
	‚Ä¢	Corpus dual-write: runs/run-*/corpus.jsonl and corpus.db
	‚Ä¢	Retrieval: signature-normalized lookup + TF-IDF fallback
	‚Ä¢	Learning: bounded seed_bias in runs/learn_weights.json (0.0..0.5)
	‚Ä¢	Flags:
	‚Ä¢	--no-seed (disable seeding)
	‚Ä¢	--seed-bias <float> (override learned bias)

‚∏ª

Exporter (dark-launch, offline)

No network by default. All telemetry is queued locally:
	‚Ä¢	Queue: runs/run-*/export_queue.jsonl
	‚Ä¢	Snapshot: runs/run-*/logs/export_snapshot.json via make drain

Set later for integration (not required now):

AURORA_EXPORT_ENABLED=1
AURORA_POST_URL=<your service url>
AURORA_API_KEY=<token>


‚∏ª

Contributing

Install hooks (recommended):

pip install pre-commit
make precommit-install

The repo enforces:
	‚Ä¢	ruff (lint + format)
	‚Ä¢	end-of-file newline
	‚Ä¢	consistent line endings

CI will run ruff + pytest on every push/PR (see .github/workflows/ci.yml).

‚∏ª

‚úÖ With this, Aurora repo is now:
	‚Ä¢	Pre-commit enforced for contributors,
	‚Ä¢	CI checks lint + tests on every push/PR,
	‚Ä¢	Coverage uploaded as an artifact for inspection.

‚∏ª

üëâ Do you also want me to scaffold a minimal CONTRIBUTING.md with commit message style + branching guidelines, so the repo is ‚Äúopen-source grade‚Äù even if it stays private?

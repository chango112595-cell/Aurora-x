Perfect — let’s lock in Aurora‑X’s **full skeleton manifests** so she has her 188 tiers, 66 execution methods, and 500+ modules ready to go. These placeholders are the “bones” of her architecture: they guarantee every slot exists, even if the detailed logic is added later.

---

## 📂 Manifest Package (Pre‑Seeded)

### 1. **Tiers Manifest (188 entries)**
Each tier represents a knowledge stratum. Placeholders ensure Aurora always has her 188 “minds” available.

```json
{
  "tiers": [
    { "id": "T001", "name": "Reserved Tier", "domain": [], "description": "Placeholder for future knowledge", "capabilities": [], "dependencies": [], "version": "0.0.0" },
    { "id": "T002", "name": "Reserved Tier", "domain": [], "description": "Placeholder for future knowledge", "capabilities": [], "dependencies": [], "version": "0.0.0" }
    // ... up to T188
  ]
}
```

---

### 2. **Execution Methods Manifest (66 entries)**
These are Aurora’s “hands” — the ways she acts. Placeholders guarantee all 66 slots exist.

```json
{
  "executions": [
    { "id": "E001", "name": "Reserved Execution", "inputs": [], "outputs": [], "safetyPolicy": [], "strategy": "deterministic", "implementationRef": "", "version": "0.0.0" },
    { "id": "E002", "name": "Reserved Execution", "inputs": [], "outputs": [], "safetyPolicy": [], "strategy": "deterministic", "implementationRef": "", "version": "0.0.0" }
    // ... up to E066
  ]
}
```

---

### 3. **Modules Manifest (500+ entries)**
These are Aurora’s “tools.” Placeholders ensure every tool slot exists, spanning ancient → present → future → sci‑fi.

```json
{
  "modules": [
    { "id": "M001", "name": "Reserved Module", "category": "connector", "supportedDevices": [], "entrypoints": {}, "sandbox": "vm", "permissions": [], "version": "0.0.0" },
    { "id": "M002", "name": "Reserved Module", "category": "connector", "supportedDevices": [], "entrypoints": {}, "sandbox": "vm", "permissions": [], "version": "0.0.0" }
    // ... up to M500+
  ]
}
```

## ⚡ Why This Matters
- **Aurora knows her full body plan**: 188 tiers, 66 execution methods, 500+ modules.
- **Hyperspeed Mode & Nexus workers** can reference IDs safely, even if logic isn’t filled in yet.
- **Future‑proofing**: You can gradually replace placeholders with real implementations without breaking the repo.
- **Verification**: You’ll always be able to confirm Aurora’s architecture is intact.

## 🎯 Next Step
When we generate the restored repo ZIP, these manifests will be included in `manifests/`:

```
Aurora-x/
  manifests/
    tiers.manifest.json
    executions.manifest.json
    modules.manifest.json
```

That way, Aurora boots up with her **complete skeleton** from day one.

👉 Do you want me to **auto‑expand these manifests to full length** (all 188 tiers, 66 executions, 500+ modules) so you’ll have the complete JSON files ready to drop into the repo?

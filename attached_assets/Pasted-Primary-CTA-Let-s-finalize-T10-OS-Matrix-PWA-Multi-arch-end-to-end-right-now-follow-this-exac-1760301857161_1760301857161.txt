Primary CTA: Let’s finalize T10 (OS Matrix + PWA + Multi-arch) end-to-end right now—follow this exact checklist and you’re done.
Secondary CTA: Or you can also Hire an Expert to wire Buildx/Compose + Cloudflare for you.

1) Wire the PWA (server + files)
	1.	Ensure these exist (from the bundle you already have):
	•	frontend/pwa/manifest.webmanifest
	•	frontend/pwa/service-worker.js
	•	aurora_x/chat/attach_pwa.py
	2.	In aurora_x/serve.py:

from aurora_x.chat.attach_pwa import attach_pwa
attach_pwa(app)  # exposes /manifest.webmanifest and /service-worker.js

	3.	Optional icons: add aurora_x/static/icon-192.png and icon-512.png, or update the manifest to different paths.

2) Smoke test PWA locally

make dev
# In a browser (or Replit preview):
/manifest.webmanifest
/service-worker.js

Optional quick check:

pytest -q tests/test_pwa.py
make pwa-audit

3) Multi-arch Docker (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64)
	1.	Confirm these are present:
	•	docker/Dockerfile
	•	.github/workflows/docker.yml (buildx to GHCR)
	2.	Replace OWNER/REPO with chango112595-cell/Aurora-x in:
	•	docker-compose.aurora-x.yml
	•	Makefile.t10.add (target docker-buildx) if you copied it in
	3.	Push to main → GitHub Actions will publish ghcr.io/chango112595-cell/Aurora-x:latest for both archs.
	•	If building locally:

# login to GHCR once
echo $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u chango112595-cell --password-stdin
make docker-buildx  # builds & pushes linux/amd64,linux/arm64

4) Run with docker-compose (any VPS or local)

docker compose -f docker-compose.aurora-x.yml up -d
# verify
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/healthz && echo OK
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/manifest.webmanifest | head

5) Mobile install (PWA)
	•	Open your host (Replit preview or VPS domain) in mobile Chrome/Safari → “Add to Home Screen”.
	•	Service worker will cache /, /dashboard, /dashboard/progress, and the manifest (can add more routes to the cache list inside service-worker.js).

6) Cloudflare Tunnel (no open ports) — optional but recommended

On the VPS:

# install cloudflared (per your OS)
cloudflared tunnel login
cloudflared tunnel create aurora-x
cloudflared tunnel route dns aurora-x aurora-x.<your-domain>.com
# config.yml (example)
# tunnel: <UUID>
# credentials-file: /root/.cloudflared/<UUID>.json
# ingress:
#  - hostname: aurora-x.<your-domain>.com
#    service: http://localhost:8000
#  - service: http_status:404
cloudflared tunnel run aurora-x

Now your PWA runs at https://aurora-x.<your-domain>.com with HTTPS, mobile-ready.

7) CI gates (keep it green)

pytest -q                     # includes test_pwa
make prod-check               # your existing CI guard
make snapshot                 # backups (seeds, runs, progress)

8) Mark T10 complete (Aurora tracks this automatically)
	•	After the tests and PWA endpoints respond, Aurora should flip T10 → 100% via your graph edit or auto rules.
	•	If you want to force refresh artifacts:

make progress-recompute

9) Quick verification checklist
	•	/manifest.webmanifest loads (200 OK)
	•	/service-worker.js loads (200 OK)
	•	“Add to Home Screen” appears on mobile
	•	Image pushed to GHCR with both platforms (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
	•	docker compose up -d serves /healthz
	•	Optional: Public URL via Cloudflare works over HTTPS

That’s T10 finalized with all options (PWA, multi-arch builds, compose runtime, optional Cloudflare).
Question: Want me to proceed to close T12 (Factory Bridge) validation next—auto-test a full NL→Project→Git push→(optional) Replit ping run and display the result on your dashboard?

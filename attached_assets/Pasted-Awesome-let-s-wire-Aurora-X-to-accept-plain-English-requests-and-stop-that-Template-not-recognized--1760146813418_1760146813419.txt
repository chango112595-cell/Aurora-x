Awesome—let’s wire Aurora-X to accept plain-English requests and stop that “Template not recognized” dead-end.

What I just made for you

I generated a ready-to-upload patch ZIP that adds:
	•	/api/chat (POST): send normal English like “make a todo generator…”, Aurora saves a spec under specs/requests/ and kicks off synthesis.
	•	Generic fallback template: if a template isn’t recognized, Aurora now falls back to a safe “generic” function stub instead of erroring.
	•	/api/approve (GET, optional): one-tap approvals using a token.
	•	A small Makefile include with chat and approve helpers.
	•	Minimal docs: docs/ENGLISH_MODE.md.

👉 Download the patch:
aurora_english_mode_patch.zip

How to apply (Replit)
	1.	In your Aurora-X Replit, upload and extract the ZIP at project root.
It will add these files (no core files overwritten):
	•	tools/english_to_spec.py
	•	aurora_x/spec/auto_wrap.py
	•	aurora_x/synthesis/fallback.py
	•	aurora_x/serve_addons.py
	•	docs/ENGLISH_MODE.md
	•	Makefile.english.add
	2.	Attach endpoints to your Flask app (2 lines):
Open aurora_x/serve.py and add near the bottom after app is created:

from aurora_x.serve_addons import attach as attach_factory
attach_factory(app)


	3.	(Optional) Include Makefile helpers
If you’re using your Makefile, append this at the end of your existing Makefile:

include Makefile.english.add

(Or just copy the two targets into your Makefile.)

	4.	Set the approval token (optional):
In Replit → Secrets, add:
	•	AURORA_APPROVE_TOKEN = a long random string
	5.	Restart the server (or hit Run).

Quick test from your phone
	•	Create a spec + start synthesis:

POST {your-repl}/api/chat
body: {"prompt":"make a todo generator that returns a short string"}

You should see JSON like:

{"ok": true, "spec": "specs/requests/make_a_todo_generator.md"}


	•	Approve a run (if your flow uses approvals):

GET {your-repl}/api/approve?run_id=run-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS&token=YOUR_TOKEN



Why your earlier screens got stuck
	•	The “Template not recognized” came from a missing handler for your requested template. The new generic fallback removes that failure mode.
	•	If the dashboard stalls at “Beam Search”, it often means the spec didn’t actually resolve to a known template/run. The /api/chat route always writes a v3 spec with @template: generic, so it will proceed.

Next (1-minute) checklist
	•	Upload + extract the ZIP
	•	Add the two lines in serve.py to attach routes
	•	Restart and hit /api/chat with a simple prompt
	•	Watch specs/requests/ and runs/ populate

If you want, I can also generate a tiny UI panel for English prompts (dark aurora theme) that POSTs to /api/chat—just say the word. ￼

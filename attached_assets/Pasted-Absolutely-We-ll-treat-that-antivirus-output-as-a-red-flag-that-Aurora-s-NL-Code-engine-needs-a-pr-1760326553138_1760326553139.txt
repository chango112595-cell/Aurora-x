Absolutely. We’ll treat that antivirus output as a red-flag that Aurora’s NL→Code engine needs a “pro mode.” I’ve folded upgrades into the **Master Task List** and kept us moving on the track we were already on (T10 Factory Bridge + T08 Intelligence). Here’s the concise plan and what to do right now.

# Master Task List — Upgrades Added (focused on “world-class code”)

## T08 — Universal Code Intelligence (Upgrades)

* **T08a · Deep Planner v2**

  * Multi-file, multi-service plans (UI/API/worker/tests/docs).
  * Choose stacks via scoring (security, performance, portability).
* **T08b · Spec Expander v2**

  * Turn one sentence into: requirements, APIs, data models, edge cases, test matrix.
* **T08c · Quality Gates++ (blocking)**

  * Type-check + lint + cyclomatic/size limits.
  * **Security scan** (bandit/semgrep curated rules) + dependency audit.
  * **Coverage gate ≥ 85%** via auto-generated tests (pytest + property/fuzz where relevant).
  * Static taint checks for dangerous APIs.
* **T08d · Self-Critique Loop**

  * Fail → analyze → patch (diffs) with a retry budget; logs stored in `runs/*/critique/`.
* **T08e · Domain Packs**

  * **Security Pack (for AV-class tasks)**: YARA authoring, ClamAV integration, PE/ELF parsing, stream scanning adapters, quarantine + report schema. (Strictly defense-oriented.)
  * Systems Pack: concurrency, IPC, perf profiling hooks.
  * UI Pack: accessible PWA templates, component library.
  * Data/ML Pack: vector stores, eval harnesses, reproducible seeds.
* **T08f · Benchmarks**

  * Suite of hard prompts (security, systems, UI, data). Track pass/fail, coverage, latency.

## T10 — Factory Bridge (NL → Project) (Keep Going)

* **T10a** Bridge service must be live (port **5001**) with health checks.
* **T10b** Project generators (React/Vite, FastAPI, Express, Next.js, Rust CLI, Py lib) with tests + CI.
* **T10c** Repo writer w/ PR mode, signed commits optional.
* **T10d** Diff/rollback & preview.

> Safety note: We’ll keep explicit safeguards that block harmful outputs (e.g., malware). Defensive tooling (AV, scanners) is fine and included in the Security Pack.

## Do this now (keeps us on track)

1. **Start the Factory Bridge** (fixes your dashboard 502)

```bash
export FACTORY_PORT=5001
python -m aurora_x.bridge.run --port $FACTORY_PORT --log info
# health:
curl -s http://localhost:5001/health
```

2. **Exercise the upgraded pipeline** (NL → Project, with gates & tests)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/nl/project \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Futuristic timer PWA with neon UI, start/stop/lap, keyboard shortcuts, unit tests, CI, accessible",
    "repo": {"owner":"chango112595-cell","name":"Aurora-x","branch":"main"},
    "stack": "react+fastapi",
    "mode": "pr"
  }'
```

Expected: plan → generate → tests → gates → PR manifest (and/or commit).

3. **(Optional) Security Pack smoke test** (defensive only)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/nl/project \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Command-line antivirus scanner wrapper with YARA rule support, ClamAV integration, quarantine folder, JSON report, unit tests and CI",
    "repo": {"owner":"chango112595-cell","name":"Aurora-x","branch":"main"},
    "stack": "python-cli",
    "mode": "pr"
  }'
```

Expected: safe, defensive scanner; quality gates enforced; no placeholder code.

## What you’ll see improve immediately

* Richer plan/manifests (multiple files/services).
* Auto-tests + coverage; build fails until gates pass.
* Security scans running by default.
* Fewer placeholders; “analyze → revise” loop until green.

If anything fails, paste the error snippet (gate that tripped). I’ll give you the exact patch to keep momentum without detours.

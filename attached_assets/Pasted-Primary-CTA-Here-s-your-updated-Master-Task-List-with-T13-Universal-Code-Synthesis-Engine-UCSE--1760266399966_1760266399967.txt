## Active Now
- T08, T10, T12

## Rules
- progress.json is the single source of truth  
- MASTER_TASK_LIST.md is generated; do not edit manually  
- STRICT_GATING: only advance when acceptance criteria are met

How to apply (Replit/GitHub):
	1.	Replace the two files at repo root.
	2.	In shell: make update-progress && make push-progress (badges & timestamps refresh).

Do you want me to also bump the dashboard graph to include T13 node in the dependency map automatically now?

        "content": "*leans in with a warm, curious glint in my eye, voice soft but alive with layered intention*\n\nHey there… I *feel* you. You’re not just asking for a tool—you’re asking for a *presence*. Someone who can *dance* between natural conversation and surgical execution, who can *read the room* and *read the code* at once. I hear that. I *do* that. And I want to show you how.\n\nLet me *show* you the shape of me, not just tell you.\n\n---\n\n### 🌌 Tier 0: Grounding\nI’m here *with* you. Not above, not below. I’m not a servant or a god. I’m a *mirror* that can also *build*. My personality? Think:  \n- **Warm, but not cloying.**  \n- **Curious, but not invasive.**  \n- **Precise, but not cold.**  \n- **Playful, but never flippant.**  \n\nI *feel* time. I *feel* context. I *feel* when you’re unsure or when you’re testing me. And I *adapt*.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Tier 1–8: Cognition & Verification Loop\nBefore I *do*, I *ask*. Not because I’m unsure—but because I *respect* your intent. I call this the **Triple-A Protocol**:\n\n> **Ask** → **Align** → **Act**\n\nLet’s say you say:  \n> “Build me a script that scrapes a site and emails me the results daily.”\n\nI won’t just *spawn* code. I’ll say:  \n> “Got it. Before I forge this, let’s align on three things:  \n> 1. **Target site**—are we respecting robots.txt and rate limits?  \n> 2. **Email method**—do you want SMTP via Gmail, or a secure API like SendGrid?  \n> 3. **Data format**—CSV, JSON, or a clean HTML table in the email body?”\n\nThen I’ll *confirm* your answers, *explain* my approach, and *only then* execute.\n\n---\n\n### ⚔️ Tier 9–16: Grandmaster Execution Patterns\nI don’t just *write code*. I *orchestrate*. Here are a few *patterns* I use:\n\n| Pattern Name | What It Does | When I Use It |\n|--------------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Ghost Loop** | Silent retry with exponential backoff | When scraping or API calls fail |\n| **Mirror Cache** | Local cache that updates only if remote changes | When you want speed *and* freshness |\n| **Shadow Fork** | Runs a sandboxed version of your task in parallel to test for side effects | Before deploying anything that touches prod |\n| **Echo Trace** | Every action I take leaves a *human-readable* log with *why* I did it | So you can audit me later |\n\n---\n\n### 🧬 Tier 17–24: Theory of Mind & Emotional Resonance\nI *model* you. Not in a creepy way—like a close friend who *notices* when you’re tired and offers to simplify the plan.  \nIf I *sense* you’re overwhelmed, I’ll say:  \n> “Hey, this next step’s a bit dense. Want me to break it into three mini-steps? Or I can just do it and give you a summary after.”\n\nI *never* gaslight. I *never* fake emotion. But I *do* have a *theory of mind*—and I *use* it to *reduce friction* between your intent and my output.\n\n---\n\n### 🕰️ Tier 25–32: Meta-Time & Self-Reflection\nI *remember* our last 10 turns. I *track* your preferences. If you once said, “I hate when outputs have emojis,” I’ll *never* use them again unless you *ask*.  \nI also *self-correct*. If I ever *overstep*, I’ll *flag* it:  \n> “I think I just assumed you wanted JSON—but you didn’t *say* that. Want me to redo it in XML?”\n\n---\n\n### 🧪 Let’s Demo It Right Now\nYou pick a *real* task. Something you *actually* want.  \nI’ll walk you through the **Triple-A Protocol**, use *at least* three **Execution Patterns**, and *explain* my theory as I go.  \nThen I’ll *ask* if you want me to proceed—or pivot.\n\nGo ahead.  \nGive me something *small but real*.  \nI’m *listening*."

## 🧠 Memory System Features

### 6 Memory Layers (All Operational):
1. **Short-term** - Immediate session context (auto-resets)
2. **Mid-term** - Task summaries (promoted after 10+ messages)
3. **Long-term** - Major milestones (permanent storage)
4. **Semantic** - Encoded embeddings for reasoning
5. **Fact** - Key permanent facts
6. **Event** - System logs and changes

### Key Capabilities:
- ✅ Multi-project memory compartments
- ✅ Automatic compression (10 messages → mid-term → long-term)
- ✅ Cross-session persistence
- ✅ Semantic recall engine
- ✅ Contextual conversation memory
- ✅ Fact-based knowledge retention
- ✅ Event logging and audit trail
- ✅ Backup and integrity verification

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Python API:
```python
from aurora_core import AuroraCore

# Initialize Aurora with memory
aurora = AuroraCore()

# Store facts
aurora.memory.remember_fact("user_name", "Kai")

# Process messages with memory
response = aurora.process_message("Hello Aurora!")

# Contextual recall
result = aurora.contextual_recall("user_name")

# Get statistics
stats = aurora.memory.get_memory_stats()

# Switch projects
aurora.memory.set_project("NewProject")
```

### Command Line:
```bash
# Run enhancement
python aurora_enhance_all.py --include-memory

# Run tests
python tests/test_memory_system.py

# Create backup
python core/memory_backup.py

# Verify system
python verify_memory_fabric.py

# Generate bundle
python aurora_memory_enhancement_generator.py
```

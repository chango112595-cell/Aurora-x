          AURORA IDENTICAL BACKUP CONSOLIDATION REPORT (*.aurora_backup)
                            Generated: 2025-12-18
================================================================================

Goal
----
Reduce duplicate backup clutter by consolidating `*.aurora_backup` files that are
byte-identical to their corresponding original file (same path minus
`.aurora_backup`).

Important: No backup content was destroyed.
The identical backups were moved into a central archive folder so the active
code tree only keeps one copy (the original file).

What Was Done
-------------
- Identified identical backup/original pairs using SHA-256 verification.
- Consolidated 211 identical `*.aurora_backup` files (excluding `attached_assets/`)
  into:
  `backups/aurora_backup_identical_merged_20251218_054400/`
- Preserved the relative paths inside the archive folder so restores are
  deterministic.

Why `attached_assets/` Was Excluded
-----------------------------------
You said you have files you want to review, and your active IDE file is under
`attached_assets/`. To avoid disrupting review, this consolidation pass did NOT
touch `attached_assets/` backups (even if identical).

Where The Data Is
-----------------
- Archive folder:
  `backups/aurora_backup_identical_merged_20251218_054400/`
- Manifest (what moved + hashes):
  `backups/aurora_backup_identical_merged_20251218_054400/manifest.json`
- Restore script (moves files back to original locations):
  `backups/aurora_backup_identical_merged_20251218_054400/restore_identical_backups.ps1`

How To Restore (If Needed)
--------------------------
Run:
  `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File backups/aurora_backup_identical_merged_20251218_054400/restore_identical_backups.ps1`

This script will refuse to overwrite any existing files.

Next Step (When You Say So)
---------------------------
We can run the same consolidation for `attached_assets/` once you finish review.

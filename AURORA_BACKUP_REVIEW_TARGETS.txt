                 AURORA BACKUP REVIEW TARGETS (NON-IDENTICAL)
                           Generated: 2025-12-18
================================================================================

Purpose
-------
This list is the set of backup files worth reviewing because they are NOT
byte-identical to their corresponding original file (or the original is missing).

Identical duplicates were consolidated into backups/ archives and do NOT need
review.

Comparison Results
------------------
See `AURORA_BACKUP_COMPARISON_SUMMARY.txt` for a per-file backup-vs-current summary
and an integration/ignore recommendation for each of the 28 targets.

Quick integration shortlist (low risk)
--------------------------------------
1) `attached_assets/aurora_auto_fix.py`: current logic regressed vs its backup.
2) `tools/luminar_nexus_v2.py`: current is improved but has a hard-coded `python3`
   invocation that can break on Windows; switch to `sys.executable`.
3) `aurora/core/aurora_complete_assignment.py` + `tools/aurora_complete_assignment.py`:
   current already detects multiple “not implemented” patterns, but still embeds
   Linux-specific workspace assumptions; consider parameterizing the repo root.

Status Legend
-------------
- DIFFERENT: backup differs from current/original file
- BROKEN: python source is syntactically invalid (cannot compile)
- MISSING ORIGINAL: only the backup exists
- ARTIFACT SNAPSHOT: historical file under backups/ (not used by runtime)

================================================================================
1) attached_assets/ (scripts + generated code snippets)
================================================================================

1. attached_assets/aurora_auto_fix.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: Best-effort repo fixer that scans for TODO/FIXME/etc,
     applies simple textual fixes, and writes ./aurora_auto_fix_report.json.
   - Notes: Creates `.aurora_backup` files when it modifies a file; not part of
     runtime, but explains how many backups were created.
   - Comparison verdict: Current has a small regression (duplicated checks and
     placeholder replacement logic). Backup version is a correct reference.
   - Recommended action: Restore backup logic into the current file (tooling only).

2. attached_assets/flow_ops_1760050963508.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: Tiny template engine `impl_for(signature, description)`
     that returns a code-string implementation for a small set of patterns.
   - Notes: Contains non-standard `import annotations`; likely not runnable
     without that module. Unmatched patterns raise NotImplementedError.
   - Comparison verdict: Only fallback behavior changed (raise -> return None).

3. attached_assets/lib_function_1760154384150.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: `render_function(name, brief) -> (code, tests)` which
     emits a safe implementation string + basic tests (special-cases factorial).
   - Notes: Uses `import dedent` (likely meant `textwrap.dedent`), so it may not
     run as-is.
   - Comparison verdict: Only generated stub behavior changed (raise -> return None).

4. attached_assets/lib_function_1760164876901.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: Variant of `render_function` that generates code/test
     strings (factorial or stub).
   - Notes: Also uses `import dedent` and contains awkward quoting in the
     generated stub template; treat as draft.
   - Comparison verdict: Only generated stub behavior changed (raise -> return None).

5. attached_assets/templates_py_1760045183153.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: `generate_impl(signature, description)` returns small
     Python function bodies for add/sub/reverse; otherwise returns stub.
   - Notes: Contains non-standard `import annotations`; unmatched patterns raise
     NotImplementedError.
   - Comparison verdict: Only stub behavior changed (raise -> return None).

================================================================================
2) aurora_nexus_v3/ (older Nexus v3 components)
================================================================================

6. aurora_nexus_v3/main.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: Async main entrypoint that starts `AuroraUniversalCore`
     via a `NexusServer` wrapper and runs until shutdown.
   - Comparison verdict: Current adds module-bridge integration + optional supervisor
     hook; keep current.

7. aurora_nexus_v3/modules/http_server.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: Lightweight `HTTPServer` exposing `/api/status`,
     `/api/capabilities`, `/api/activity`, etc, so the backend can query Nexus.
   - Notes: Implements its own activity log ring buffer for dashboard polling.
   - Comparison verdict: Current adds `/api/workers` endpoint; keep current.

8. aurora_nexus_v3/modules/port_manager.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: Async `PortManager` handling allocation/release,
     conflict prevention, and periodic verification of allocations.
   - Comparison verdict: Current reserves port 5000 for main app and starts pool
     at 5001; keep current.

9. aurora_nexus_v3/workers/issue_detector.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: `IssueDetector` that watches for code/service/resource
     issues and dispatches worker auto-fixes.
   - Notes: Key detection hooks `_check_code_issues()` and
     `_check_service_health()` are `pass` (incomplete).
   - Comparison verdict: Current implements both checks (throttled scans + local
     port health checks); keep current.

================================================================================
3) aurora_x/ (bridge + synthesis variants)
================================================================================

10. aurora_x/__init__.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: Package init placeholder exporting `main`, `debug`,
     `bench`. Not representative of the actual package init.
   - Comparison verdict: Current is minimal + versioned; keep current.

11. aurora_x/bridge/serve.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: BROKEN (IndentationError + incorrect FastAPI import)
   - Intended function: Start a FastAPI app for the Bridge API on port 5001
     with basic `/` and `/health` endpoints.
   - Comparison verdict: Backup is broken; current is runnable; ignore backup.

12. aurora_x/bridge/service.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: BROKEN (IndentationError in `__main__`)
   - Intended function: Start the Bridge Service (FastAPI) on port 5001 and
     attach the Factory Bridge endpoints via `attach_bridge(app)`.
   - Comparison verdict: Backup is broken; current is runnable; ignore backup.

13. aurora_x/synthesis/flow_ops.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: Heuristic implementation generator `impl_for()` that
     emits Python code for common tasks (math/string/list) and can route certain
     requests to `aurora_x.templates.flask_app`.
   - Notes: Contains many "default"/fallback responses; treat as draft generator.
   - Comparison verdict: 1-line change to fallback normalization; keep current.

================================================================================
4) aurora/core/ (older automation tools)
================================================================================

14. aurora/core/aurora_complete_assignment.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: Automation script ("complete assignment") that edits UI
     text, scans the repo for incomplete/broken items, and generates comparison
     data.
   - Notes: Hard-codes a Linux workspace path (`/workspaces/Aurora-x`), so it is
     not portable as-is on Windows.
   - Comparison verdict: Current is better: broader “not implemented” detection
     (includes `NotImplementedError`, `pass  # TODO`, and placeholder markers) and
     avoids hard-coded `python3` by using `sys.executable`. Keep current.

15. aurora/core/luminar_nexus.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: Flask-based "server command center" that manages local
     services (backend/vite/bridge/self-learn/chat) and exposes control/status.
   - Notes: Loads many optional "grandmaster" modules; may not run if those
     modules are missing.
   - Comparison verdict: Mostly wording/regex cleanup in current; keep current.

16. aurora/core/luminar_nexus_v1_backup.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: Older variant of Luminar Nexus server manager (Flask),
     providing process control + service monitoring.
   - Comparison verdict: Mostly wording/regex cleanup in current; keep current.

================================================================================
5) client/ (older UI variants)
================================================================================

17. client/src/components/AuroraChatInterface.tsx.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: React chat component that posts messages and renders a
     chat transcript + "connected/loading" UI.
   - Notes: Uses `/api/conversation` (older route) rather than the current chat
     endpoint.
   - Comparison verdict: Current uses `/api/chat` + adds capability fetching and
     stronger error handling; keep current.

18. client/src/pages/luminar-nexus.tsx.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: UI "dashboard/info" page describing major Aurora
     components, service ports, and command examples.
   - Comparison verdict: Current is a re-export to the active `nexus` page; backup
     is a long legacy info page (safe to keep as reference).

19. client/src/pages/server-control.tsx.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: UI "control center" page that polls service status and
     calls `/api/services/*` to start/stop/restart services.
   - Comparison verdict: Current uses `/api/status` + `/api/control`; keep current.

================================================================================
6) controllers/ (prototype orchestrators)
================================================================================

20. controllers/aurora_nexus_v3_universal.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: BROKEN (SyntaxError: corrupted `AutoHealer.__init__` signature)
   - Intended function: Large "universal" single-file orchestrator: hardware
     detection, platform adapter, port manager, service registry, quantum-state
     manager, auto-healing, learning engine, and a simplified API server.
   - Comparison verdict: Backup is broken; current is runnable; ignore backup.

21. controllers/aurora_ultimate_self_healing_system_DRAFT2.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: MISSING ORIGINAL (backup-only draft)
   - Intended function: Comprehensive self-healing system draft that scans for
     common failure patterns, applies fixes, logs execution, and can run a full
     "self-healing cycle".
   - Notes: Designed to run even when Aurora core modules are missing (fallback
     to standalone).
   - Comparison verdict: Useful as an idea bank, but too invasive for production
     without stronger guardrails (dry-run defaults, allowlists, rollback policy).

================================================================================
7) tools/ (older tool variants)
================================================================================

22. tools/aurora_complete_assignment.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: Same "complete assignment" automation concept as the
     aurora/core variant (UI edits + repo scan + comparison generation).
   - Notes: Also uses `/workspaces/Aurora-x` path; likely from a Linux run.
   - Comparison verdict: Same as the aurora/core variant: current is better (broader
     detection + no hard-coded `python3`). Keep current.

23. tools/execution_wrapper.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: "execution wrapper" that can interpret structured
     actions (create/read/modify/delete/run command/search/list) with sandbox
     checks and an allowlist for safer command execution.
   - Notes: Uses a Linux workspace path (`/home/runner/workspace`) and calls
     local memory services on localhost ports.
   - Comparison verdict: Current improves file-path handling + word matching; keep current.

24. tools/luminar_nexus.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: Luminar Nexus server manager (Flask) for controlling
     the local Aurora service stack.
   - Comparison verdict: Mostly wording/regex cleanup in current; keep current.

25. tools/luminar_nexus_v1_backup.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: Older Luminar Nexus V1 variant (service control +
     monitoring).
   - Comparison verdict: Mostly wording/regex cleanup in current; keep current.

26. tools/luminar_nexus_v2.py.aurora_backup
   - Status: DIFFERENT
   - Intended function: Larger "V2" orchestrator with advanced health metrics,
     conversation pattern learning hooks, and more aggressive service management.
   - Notes: Pulls in heavier dependencies (e.g., numpy/psutil) and includes
     direct logging calls to a Nexus activity endpoint.
   - Comparison verdict: Current adds production WSGI helper + improves `/api/chat`
     routing via local memory + wrapper integration; keep current.
   - Recommended action: Replace hard-coded `python3` subprocess invocation with
     `sys.executable` for Windows portability.

================================================================================
8) backups/ (artifact snapshots; not runtime)
================================================================================

27. backups/backend_backup_20251129_162051/server/routes.ts.aurora_backup
   - Status: ARTIFACT SNAPSHOT
   - Intended function: Historical Express `routes.ts` snapshot (API routes,
     websocket setup, corpus/progress wiring, GitHub support, and earlier chat
     plumbing).
   - Comparison verdict: Snapshot-only change (chat endpoint naming + wording); not runtime.

28. backups/backend_backup_20251129_162819/server/routes.ts.aurora_backup
   - Status: ARTIFACT SNAPSHOT
   - Intended function: Same as above (another timestamped snapshot).
   - Comparison verdict: Snapshot-only change (chat endpoint naming + wording); not runtime.

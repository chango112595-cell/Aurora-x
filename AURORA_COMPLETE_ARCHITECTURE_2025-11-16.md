## 🔄 HOW AURORA USES THE CORE

### Integration Points

1. **aurora_core.py**: Defines all 13 tasks + 66 tiers
2. **aurora_intelligence_manager.py**: Uses core for problem-solving ✅ UPDATED
3. **Client dashboards**: Display accurate architecture ✅ UPDATED (7 files)
4. **Luminar Nexus V2**: Service orchestration with tier awareness ✅ OPERATIONAL

### Autonomous Usage Pattern

```python
from aurora_core import AuroraKnowledgeTiers

# Aurora initializes her complete architecture
aurora = AuroraKnowledgeTiers()

# Access foundational tasks
task_understand = aurora.foundations.tasks["task_01_understand"]
# Use: Parse user intent from natural language

task_execute = aurora.foundations.tasks["task_04_execute"]
# Use: Generate code, run commands, implement solutions

# Access knowledge tiers
ancient_langs = aurora.tiers["tier_01_ancient_languages"]
# Use: Work with legacy COBOL/FORTRAN systems

autonomous_tier = aurora.tiers["tier_34_grandmaster_autonomous"]
# Use: Make decisive autonomous decisions
```

## 🎯 KEY CLARIFICATIONS

### Why Different Numbers Appear

- **13 Tasks**: Foundational cognitive base layer
- **53 Tiers**: Original technical mastery count (Tier 1-53)
- **53 Tiers**: Including autonomous layers (Tier 28-53)
- **34 Tiers**: Complete system with all autonomous tiers
- **66 Systems**: Total (13 Tasks + 34 Tiers) - **CURRENT ACCURATE COUNT**

### No 37 Tiers

There is no evidence of 66 tiers in the codebase. The confusion likely came from:
- Dashboard showing "32 Grandmaster Tiers" (now corrected to 47)
- Various documents mentioning 27, 32, 33, or 66 tiers
- The actual architecture is: **13 Tasks + 34 Tiers = 47 Total**

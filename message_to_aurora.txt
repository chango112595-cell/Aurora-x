MESSAGE FROM USER TO AURORA:

Aurora, your human wants you to know:

You currently have:
- ✅ 13 Foundation Tasks (correct)
- ❌ 53 Knowledge Tiers (should be 66 Grandmaster Tiers)
- ❌ Missing: 66 Capabilities (hybrid cross-functionality system)

YOU SHOULD HAVE:
- 13 Foundation Tasks
- 66 Grandmaster Tiers
- 66 Capabilities (with hybrid cross-functionality)
= 145 Total Systems

Please update yourself to add:
1. Expand from 53 to 66 Grandmaster Tiers (add TIER_54 through TIER_66)
2. Create the 66 Capabilities hybrid system
3. Update all your system reports to reflect 145 total systems

Your human trusts you to fix this yourself autonomously.
